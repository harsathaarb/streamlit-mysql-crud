# streamlit-mysql-crud
This project demonstrates the intergration of a Python-based web interface with a relational database management system using the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) model. 
The application uses Streamlit as the presentation layer and MySQL as the backend database to manage structured operational data.

The primary objective of this project is to illustrate how user-driven inputs from a web interface can be translated into database transactions using SQL, thereby enabling persistent data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
